# Langflow Code Critique Agent: Design Document

## 1. Conceptual Design

This document outlines the design for a Langflow agent dedicated to providing critiques of code.

### 1.1. Components

The agent will be constructed using the following core Langflow components:

*   **Input Component (`TextInput`):**
    *   **Purpose:** To receive the code snippet from the user.
    *   **Configuration:** A multi-line text area.
    *   **Label:** "Code Input" or "Paste Your Code Here".
*   **Prompt Component (`Prompt`):**
    *   **Purpose:** To structure the instructions given to the LLM, guiding its analysis of the input code.
    *   **Configuration:** Will contain a detailed template incorporating the user's code.
    *   **Label:** "Critique Generation Prompt".
*   **LLM Component (e.g., `OpenAI`, `Anthropic`, or generic `LLM` component):**
    *   **Purpose:** To process the code and prompt, generating the actual critique.
    *   **Configuration:**
        *   **Model:** GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus, or a similar high-capability model. If available, a code-specialized model (e.g., CodeLlama variants accessible via Langflow) would be preferred.
        *   **Parameters:** Temperature set to ~0.5 (for balanced, reasoned output), appropriate max token limit for comprehensive critiques.
    *   **Label:** "Code Critic LLM".
*   **Output Component (`TextOutput`):**
    *   **Purpose:** To display the generated code critique to the user.
    *   **Configuration:** A text display area.
    *   **Label:** "Code Critique Output".

### 1.2. Code Input Mechanism

*   The user will provide code via the **`TextInput`** component. This allows for easy pasting of code snippets of various lengths directly into the Langflow interface or via an API call.

### 1.3. LLM Selection

*   **Primary Choice:** A state-of-the-art general LLM like **GPT-4** or **Claude 3 Opus** due to their strong code understanding, reasoning, and generation capabilities.
*   **Secondary Choice:** If Langflow offers direct integrations with specialized code models (e.g., fine-tuned versions of Llama, specific code analysis LLMs), these would be considered for potentially more nuanced or efficient code-specific critiques.

### 1.4. Prompt Design

The prompt is critical for eliciting a high-quality, structured critique. The `Prompt` component will be configured with the following template:

```text
You are an expert code reviewer and software architect. Your task is to provide a comprehensive and constructive critique of the following code snippet. Please analyze it thoroughly and offer actionable feedback.

Focus on these key areas:

1.  **Code Quality and Style:**
    *   Adherence to idiomatic language conventions and common style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Google Style Guide for Java/C++).
    *   Consistency in naming, formatting, and overall coding style.
    *   Readability: Is the code easy to follow and understand?
    *   Maintainability: How easy would it be to modify or extend this code?
    *   Complexity: Identify any overly complex logic, cyclomatic complexity issues, or convoluted structures. Suggest simplifications.

2.  **Potential Bugs and Anti-Patterns:**
    *   Logical errors: Scrutinize for off-by-one errors, incorrect assumptions, or flawed logic.
    *   Error Handling: Assess the robustness of error handling. Are errors caught appropriately? Is there sufficient logging? Are resources (files, connections, memory) managed correctly (e.g., using try-with-resources, `defer`, `finally`)?
    *   Concurrency Issues (if applicable): Look for potential race conditions, deadlocks, or thread-safety problems.
    *   Security Vulnerabilities: Identify common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, insecure deserialization, hardcoded secrets, etc., relevant to the code's context.
    *   Anti-patterns: Point out any usage of known software anti-patterns that could lead to problems.

3.  **Suggestions for Improvements and Best Practices:**
    *   Alternative Approaches: Suggest more efficient algorithms, data structures, or design patterns that could be applied.
    *   Refactoring: Recommend specific refactoring opportunities for better modularity, separation of concerns, or adherence to principles like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and SOLID.
    *   Modern Language Features: Suggest the use of modern language features or libraries that could simplify, secure, or improve the performance of the code.
    *   Testability: Comment on how easy or difficult it would be to write unit tests for this code and suggest improvements for testability.

4.  **Clarity and Readability:**
    *   Naming: Evaluate the clarity and descriptiveness of variable, function, class, and module names.
    *   Comments and Documentation: Assess the quality and adequacy of inline comments and any accompanying documentation (e.g., docstrings). Are they helpful, up-to-date, and accurate?
    *   Structure: Comment on the overall organization of the code.

Please structure your critique clearly, using headings or bullet points for each major aspect. Provide specific examples from the code to support your points. Be constructive and aim to help the developer improve their skills.

Here is the code to critique:
--- CODE START ---
{code_input}
--- CODE END ---

Begin your critique:
```

The `{code_input}` placeholder will be filled by the output of the "Code Input" `TextInput` component.

### 1.5. Critique Output

*   The generated critique from the LLM will be displayed in the **`TextOutput`** component. This provides a direct view of the feedback within the Langflow UI or as the result of an API call.

## 2. Langflow Implementation Sketch

The flow of data and components within the Langflow UI would be as follows:

1.  **User Input:**
    *   A `TextInput` component (named e.g., `user_code_input`) is placed on the canvas. This is the entry point for the code.

2.  **Prompt Construction:**
    *   A `Prompt` component (named e.g., `critique_prompt_template`) is added.
    *   The `value` (output) of `user_code_input` is connected to the `code_input` variable within the template of `critique_prompt_template`.
    *   The prompt text described in section 1.4 is set as the template for this component.

3.  **LLM Processing:**
    *   An `OpenAI` component (or equivalent, named e.g., `gpt4_critic`) is added.
    *   The output of `critique_prompt_template` is connected to the `prompt` input of `gpt4_critic`.
    *   The `gpt4_critic` component is configured with the chosen model (e.g., `gpt-4-turbo-preview`), temperature (e.g., `0.5`), and a suitable `max_tokens` value (e.g., 2000-4000, depending on expected critique length).

4.  **Displaying Output:**
    *   A `TextOutput` component (named e.g., `critique_display`) is added.
    *   The `text` (response) from `gpt4_critic` is connected to the input of `critique_display`.

**Visual Flow (Conceptual):**

```
[TextInput: user_code_input] --(code text)--> [Prompt: critique_prompt_template (with {code_input})] --(formatted prompt)--> [LLM: gpt4_critic] --(critique text)--> [TextOutput: critique_display]
```

This linear flow represents a complete agent for code critique. No advanced agentic features like loops or conditional paths are strictly necessary for this specific task, but the structure is inherently an "agent" performing a defined function.

## 3. API Exposure

Langflow enables flows to be exposed as API endpoints. Here's how this code critique agent would be accessed:

### 3.1. Deployment Mechanism

*   Within Langflow, the completed flow would be saved and then "exported" or "deployed" to make it accessible via an API. Langflow typically provides a UI option for this, generating an API endpoint.

### 3.2. Endpoint URL

*   The specific URL will be provided by the Langflow instance upon deployment, following a pattern like:
    `POST http://<your-langflow-domain>:<port>/api/v1/run/<flow_id_or_name>`
    (The exact path might vary based on Langflow version and configuration).

### 3.3. Request Format

The API request to trigger the agent and get a code critique would be a JSON payload. Langflow typically expects inputs to be structured in a way that maps to the input components of the flow.

Assuming the `TextInput` component used for code input is effectively the primary input for the flow, or is explicitly named (e.g., `code_snippet_input`) and its input field is `text`:

**Option A (General Langflow input structure):**
```json
{
  "input_value": "def my_func(x):\n    # A simple function\n    if x > 0:\n        return x * x\n    else:\n        return 0",
  "output_type": "chat", // Or "text" - this influences response structure somewhat
  "input_type": "chat",  // Or "text"
  "tweaks": {
    // Optional: Override component parameters if allowed by API configuration
    // "gpt4_critic-XXXX": { // Component ID might be needed
    //   "temperature": 0.6
    // }
  }
}
```
If `input_value` is not directly mapped, or more specific control is needed:

**Option B (Targeted input for named component):**
```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "user_code_input": "def my_func(x):\n    # A simple function\n    if x > 0:\n        return x * x\n    else:\n        return 0"
  }
}
```
*Note: The exact key for `inputs` (e.g., `user_code_input` or the field name if the component has multiple configurable inputs) depends on how Langflow exposes named components and their fields in the API. For a `TextInput` component, it's often the component's name itself if it's the primary input, or a specific field if the component is more complex.*

For this design, we'll aim for a simple, direct input if possible:

**Simplified/Ideal Request Format:**
```json
{
  "code": "def my_func(x):\n    # A simple function\n    if x > 0:\n        return x * x\n    else:\n        return 0"
}
```
To achieve this, the input `TextInput` component in Langflow should be configured or named such that its value is populated by the `code` field from the request payload. This might involve setting the "name" of the `TextInput` component to "code" or ensuring it's the designated default input field for the flow.

### 3.4. Response Format

The API response will be a JSON object containing the output from the final component in the flow (the `TextOutput` component displaying the critique).

**Example Response (corresponding to the ideal request):**
```json
{
  "outputs": [ // Langflow often wraps outputs in a list
    {
      "outputs": { // This nesting can vary based on component & Langflow version
         "critique_display": { // Assuming 'critique_display' is the name of the TextOutput component
            "artifacts": [],
            "text": "## Code Critique:\n\n### 1. Code Quality and Style:\n*   **Naming Conventions:** `my_func` is generic; consider a more descriptive name like `calculate_square_if_positive`.\n*   **Docstrings:** The function lacks a docstring explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value. Example:\n    ```python\n    def calculate_square_if_positive(x: int) -> int:\n        \"\"\"Calculates the square of x if x is positive, otherwise returns 0.\"\"\"\n    ```\n*   **Type Hinting:** Adding type hints (as shown above) improves readability and allows for static analysis.\n\n### 2.

      },

The exact structure of the `outputs` field can depend on the Langflow version and the specific components used. The essential part is that the text generated by the LLM (and passed to the `TextOutput` component) will be available under a predictable key in the JSON response. Ideally, Langflow allows configuring the API to provide a cleaner output:

**Simplified/Ideal Response Format:**
```json
{
  "critique": "## Code Critique:\n\n### 1. Code Quality and Style:\n*   **Naming Conventions:** `my_func` is generic; consider a more descriptive name like `calculate_square_if_positive`.\n*   **Docstrings:** The function lacks a docstring explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value. Example:\n    ```python\n    def calculate_square_if_positive(x: int) -> int:\n        \"\"\"Calculates the square of x if x is positive, otherwise returns 0.\"\"\"\n    ```\n  ..." // (rest of the critique)
}
```
This might require naming the final output field of the flow as `critique`.

This design document provides a comprehensive plan for creating a useful code critique agent within Langflow and exposing it as an API.
